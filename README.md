Back in 2014 miloyip create new repo with a spoken name https://github.com/miloyip/nativejson-benchmark
His _rapidjson_ and my _gason_ easly knockout other 20+ parser. But rapid be slightly faster then gason, and I decided not to leave it.
But I too lazy, to do it again. Parser in this repo faster then everything
